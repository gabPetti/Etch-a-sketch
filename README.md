# Etch-a-sketch

This project was made in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundation Course.
For this project, I used HTML, Javascript and CSS to make an online etch-a-sketch game.

## Features
- 0x0 to 50x50 canvas (any size above that would crash the browser)

- Rainbow pen feature
- Gridlines toggle button
- Clear canvas button
